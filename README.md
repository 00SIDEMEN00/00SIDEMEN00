- ⚡ Fun fact:
- Did you know that the term "debugging" in software engineering comes from a literal bug?
In 1947, a team of engineers at Harvard University were working on the Mark II computer when they encountered a malfunction. Upon investigation
they discovered a moth trapped in the relay circuits, causing the problem. The engineers removed the moth and taped it into their logbook, writing "First actual case of bug being found."
This incident gave rise to the term "debugging" in computer science, referring to the process of finding and fixing errors in software code.
So, the next time you're troubleshooting a pesky bug in your code, remember the humble moth that helped coin the term!
